his work uses a machine learning model to characterize red wine based on chemical composition. It uses a Random Forest classifier and includes methods such as SMOTE for dealing with class imbalances and GridSearchCV for dealing with hyperparameter tuning. The model was trained on a publicly available dataset. And it includes functions for data loading, visualization, pre-processing, training, analysis and prediction...
features

    Data Loading: Loads the wine quality dataset from the specified URL.
    Image: Use Seaborne to visualize the distribution of fine wine.
    Data pre-processing: divide the dataset into training and test sets by normalizing features.
    Sample training: Use SMOTE to train a random forest sample to be oversampled. and class weighting to deal with imbalanced classes.
